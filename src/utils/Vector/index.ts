/**
2d Vector class with support for vector operations.

The class is designed with memory efficiency in mind,
to avoid polluting the heap with vector instances.
For this reason the only method that creates a new
vector instance is the constructor and all the
changes occur in place, i.e. the `this` vector is
modified instead of creating a new instance for each
operation.

All methods return the modified vector to allow for
chaining.

For the methods that need the creation of auxiliary
vectors, the class uses an instance of the VectorPool
class that should be cleared on every iteration of
the main loop.
